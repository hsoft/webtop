# webtop: apachetop in Rust

Move along, this is just me playing around with Rust. I was really *aching* to try it and I looked
for something, anything. I though "well, why not yet another apachetop?".

It's built on curses using [ncurses-rs][ncurses-rs]

For now, it's nothing interesting, really. Move along.
